# Hypotenusa Calculator

This is a simple web application that calculates the hypotenusa of a right-angled triangle based on the values of its two legs. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply enter the lengths of the two legs of the right-angled triangle into the corresponding input fields. Then click the "Calculate" button to compute the length of the hypotenusa. The result will be displayed in the output field.

## Hypotenusa Calculation Logic

The JavaScript code uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenusa. The formula is:

h = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)


where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two legs, and `c` is the length of the hypotenusa. The `sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.
